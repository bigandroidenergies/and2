# Magnus the Red

Magnus the Red, also known during the early years of the Imperium as the "Crimson King" and the "Red Cyclops," is the primarch of the Thousand Sons Traitor Legion and an extremely powerful Daemon Prince of the Chaos God Tzeentch.

A giant in both physical and mental terms whilst still an inhabitant of the Materium, the copper-skinned Magnus possessed tremendous innate psychic ability, and constantly sought to understand the nature of the Warp, becoming a sorcerer of formidable power.

Magnus thought he would be able to control the "Great Ocean" of psychic energy that was the Warp; however, his prodigious and careless application of his psychic gifts eventually caused him to fall out of favour with his father, the Emperor of Mankind, as well as with the majority of his brother primarchs. His psychic immaturity, recklessness, selfish pride and arrogance also caused his own undoing, as it eventually brought about his own damnation and eternal servitude to the Dark God of Change, Tzeentch.

In the end, Magnus led his XVth Legion to the banner of Horus and fought on the Arch-heretic's side during the Great Betrayal of the Horus Heresy. He survived those events and ascended to the position of a Daemon Primarch of Tzeentch as a reward for his service to the Changer of Ways.

Magnus has spent the majority of the ten Terran millennia since the end of the Horus Heresy ensconced atop his tower upon Sortiarius, the Planet of the Sorcerers within the Eye of Terror, planning the ultimate destruction of the Imperium he believes betrayed him and his Legion.

Magnus' greatest grudge, however, is with the Space Marines of the Space Wolves, who he holds accountable for the destruction of his homeworld of Prospero and the corruption of his Legion during the early days of the Horus Heresy.

During the Siege of the Fenris System the Thousand Sons unleashed on the Space Wolves' homeworld in ca. 999.M41, Magnus used the sacrifice of the population of the Death World of Midgardia in the Fenris System -- destroyed by an Exterminatus action ordered by the Great Wolf Logan Grimnar of the Space Wolves after its people were infected with a hideous plague engineered by the Daemon Primarch Mortarion of the Death Guard -- to fuel the teleportation of the Planet of the Sorcerers from the Eye of Terror to a new orbit above the remains of the Thousand Sons' lost homeworld of Prospero. This ritual restored Magnus and the Thousand Sons to the Materium, and created a gigantic new Warp rift in the region that began to spew forth Daemons that would make up Magnus' new army.

In the Era Indomitus, Magnus has devoted himself to offering a new home to Human psykers on Sortiarius where they will be allowed to use their powers without the limits and persecution forced upon them by the Imperium. This call has gained particular resonance for many psykers since the strengthening of all psychic activity in the galaxy with the Psychic Awakening brought about by the birth of the Great Rift.
